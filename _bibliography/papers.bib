               distal enhancers through the establishment of chromosome
               structure and long-range enhancer-promoter interactions. The
               best characterized cohesin-related structures, such as
               topologically associating domains (TADs) anchored at convergent
               CTCF binding sites, represent static conformations.
               Consequently, loop extrusion dynamics remain poorly understood.
               To better characterize static and dynamically extruding
               chromatin loop structures, we use MNase-based 3D genome assays
               to simultaneously determine CTCF and cohesin localization as
               well as the 3D contacts they mediate. Here we present CTCF
               Analyzer (with) Multinomial Estimation (CAMEL), a tool that
               identifies CTCF footprints at near base-pair resolution in CTCF
               MNase HiChiP. We also use Region Capture Micro-C to identify a
               CTCF-adjacent footprint that is attributed to cohesin
               occupancy. We leverage this substantial advance in resolution to
               determine that the fully extruded (CTCF-CTCF loop) state is
               rare genome-wide with locus-specific variation from ~1-10\%. We
               further investigate the impact of chromatin state on loop
               extrusion dynamics and find that active regulatory elements
               impede cohesin extrusion. These findings support a model of
               topological regulation whereby the transient, partially extruded
               state facilitates enhancer-promoter contacts that can regulate
               transcription.",

               compartments, A and B, which partition active and inactive
               chromatin states. While constitutive heterochromatin is
               predominantly located within the B compartment near the nuclear
               lamina, facultative heterochromatin marked by H3K27me3 spans
               both compartments. How epigenetic modifications,
               compartmentalization, and lamina association collectively
               maintain heterochromatin architecture remains unclear. Here we
               develop Lamina-Inducible Methylation and Hi-C (LIMe-Hi-C) to
               jointly measure chromosome conformation, DNA methylation, and
               lamina positioning. Through LIMe-Hi-C, we identify topologically
               distinct sub-compartments with high levels of H3K27me3 and
               differing degrees of lamina association. Inhibition of Polycomb
               repressive complex 2 (PRC2) reveals that H3K27me3 is essential
               for sub-compartment segregation. Unexpectedly, PRC2 inhibition
               promotes lamina association and constitutive heterochromatin
               spreading into H3K27me3-marked B sub-compartment regions.
               Consistent with this repositioning, genes originally marked with
               H3K27me3 in the B compartment, but not the A compartment, remain
               largely repressed, suggesting that constitutive heterochromatin
               spreading can compensate for H3K27me3 loss at a transcriptional
               level. These findings demonstrate that Polycomb sub-compartments
               and their antagonism with lamina association are fundamental
               features of genome structure. More broadly, by jointly measuring
               nuclear position and Hi-C contacts, our study demonstrates how
               compartmentalization and lamina association represent distinct

              here that megabase-scale patterns of hypomethylation distinguish
              first from third trimester chorionic villi in the placenta, and
              that these patterns mirror those that distinguish many tumors
              from corresponding normal tissues. We confirmed these findings in
              villous cytotrophoblasts isolated from the placenta and
              identified a time window at the end of the first trimester, when
              these cells come into contact with maternal blood, as the likely
              time period for the methylome alterations. Furthermore, the large
              genomic regions affected by these patterns of hypomethylation
              encompass genes involved in pathways related to
              epithelial-mesenchymal transition, immune response, and
              inflammation. Analyses of expression profiles corresponding to
              genes in these hypomethylated regions in colon adenocarcinoma
              tumors point to networks of differentially expressed genes
              previously implicated in carcinogenesis and placentogenesis,
              where nuclear factor kappa B is a key hub. Taken together, our
              results suggest the existence of epigenetic switches involving
              large-scale changes of methylation in the placenta during
              pregnancy and in tumors during neoplastic transformation. The
              characterization of such epigenetic switches might lead to the
              identification of biomarkers and drug targets in oncology as well
              as in obstetrics and gynecology.",
