title: Regulatory DNA loops
description: Chromatin loops that bring linearly distant loci into close physical proximity are essential for much transcriptional regulation, and can either promote or inhibit gene activation in a context dependent manner. We have previously developed tools for identification and statistical testing of DNA loops, and are now focused on characterizing dynamic, transient regulatory interactions that appear, somewhat surprisingly, to represent the most common state of gene promoters.

Example work: DNA looping is vital for establishing many regulatory interactions. While CTCF is known to anchor many cohesin-mediated loops, recent work has shown that the the looped chromatin fiber appears to predominantly exist in a poorly characterized actively extruding state. To better characterize extruding chromatin loop structures, we used CTCF MNase HiChIP data to determine both CTCF binding at high resolution and 3D contact information. Here we present FactorFinder, a tool that identifies CTCF binding sites at near base-pair resolution. We leverage this substantial advance in resolution to determine that the fully extruded (CTCF-CTCF) state is rare genome-wide with locus-specific variation from âˆ¼1-10%. We further investigate the impact of chromatin state on loop extrusion dynamics, and find that active enhancers and RNA Pol II impede cohesin extrusion, facilitating an enrichment of enhancer-promoter contacts in the partially extruded loop state. We propose a model of topological regulation whereby the transient, partially extruded states play active roles in transcription.
