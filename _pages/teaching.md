**Introduction to Statistical Genetics**

Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health  
Fall Semester - Starting October 26, 2020

Course number: BST227

This course will provide an introduction to statistical methods for genetic studies.
The emphasis of this course is on understanding basic concepts and methods and how
they are applied in the analysis of population genetic data. The course starts out
with an overview of methods for identifying disease-associated variants, and then goes
on to cover approaches for interpreting the role of these variants in disease.
A background in genetics is not necessary. The basic concepts of human and molecular
genetics relevant to the course will be covered in class.
