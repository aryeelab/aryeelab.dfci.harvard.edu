We develop computational and statistical methods for extracting signal from noisy genomic datasets, with a focus on cancer epigenomics. Our group membersâ€™ interests range from understanding the basic epigenetic mechanisms underlying human disease, to developing blood-based early cancer detection diagnostics and understanding how genome and epigenome editing can be used to reverse disease-causing mutations.

We are part of the Department of Data Science at Dana Farber Cancer Institute, the Department of Biostatistics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and the Broad Institute.
